# What This Project is About
This project aims to use data analysis techniques improve my winrate in the strategy game Warhammer:Total War.

## Ranked Matchmaking Ladder
To add more options for Total War players, and to gather data, I created a discord bot to manage elo based matchmaking, much like online chess sites. The project sees daily traffic with multiple players playing actively. The data gathering sctions are still in development.

## Game Screenshot to excel
This program takes data shown at the end of games and adds the data to an excel file. The game doesn't have an API to collect data so I applied various image recognition techniques to read the data from screen shots.

## Player Ranking List Via Online Tournament Data
The project used the web API of an online tournament hosting site to rank all players by skill. Skill was determined by examining the wins and losses of each player using elo to calculate skill.
